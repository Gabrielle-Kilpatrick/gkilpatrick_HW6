            <p>My family has been with me every step of the way through college and have been a great support throughout the years.</p>
            <p>I come from a rather extended family, and often consider my close friends as part of my own family too.</p>
            <p>One of my favorite things about my family is how different everyone is, as well as our mutual enjoyment of travel</p>
